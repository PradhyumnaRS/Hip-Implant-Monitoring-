# 📖 Data Dictionary: Hip Implant Tribocorrosion Monitoring

This dataset contains multi-modal sensor readings captured during controlled laboratory experiments simulating the structural and chemical degradation of orthopedic hip implants.

## 1. Feature Variables (Inputs)

### **Time**
* **Unit:** Seconds (s)
* **Sensor:** System Clock
* **Description:** The total elapsed time from the start of the experimental cycle.

### **AE (Acoustic Emission)**
* **Unit:** Volts (V)
* **Sensor:** Piezoelectric Sensor (Hardware-amplified)
* **Description:** High-frequency elastic stress waves generated by mechanical friction or internal micro-fractures within the implant. This is a primary indicator of mechanical structural integrity.

### **EC (Electrochemical Potential)**
* **Unit:** Volts (V)
* **Sensor:** Electrochemical Interface
* **Description:** Measures the integrity of the metallic passive layer. Spikes or sustained shifts in this value indicate a chemical breach or corrosion event triggered by surface wear.

### **M (Material)**
* **Unit:** Categorical (Metadata)
* **Description:** Represents the specific metallurgical composition of the implant alloy being tested (e.g., Titanium, Cobalt-Chromium).

## 2. Target Variable (Output)

### **O (System Status)**
The target variable 'O' represents the diagnostic classification of the implant's state.

* **Class 0: Healthy (Baseline)**
  * **State:** The implant is structurally stable with an intact passive layer. Readings represent nominal background noise.
  * **Visual Profile:** Low-amplitude AE and stable EC potential.

* **Class 1: Incipient Wear**
  * **State:** Early-stage surface degradation has begun. 
  * **Visual Profile:** Frequent electrochemical spikes indicating localized passive layer breach and moderate acoustic bursts.

* **Class 2: Critical Failure**
  * **State:** Significant structural or chemical breach.
  * **Visual Profile:** Sustained high-amplitude acoustic emissions and major shifts in the electrochemical baseline.

## 3. Hardware & Acquisition Context

### **Signal Conditioning**
All raw signals from the Acoustic Emission sensors passed through a signal conditioning stage before being digitized.
* **Operational Amplifier:** LM358
* **Calculated Gain:** 6.5 (Standardized across all experiments)

### **Processing Pipeline**
* **Acquisition:** Data was managed via a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W and Arduino Nano interface.
* **Normalization:** All numerical features have been processed using StandardScaler (Mean = 0, StDev = 1) to ensure algorithm convergence.
